Task descriptions and solutions

Topic. Multiple Inheritance. Polymorphism. 

Using Magic Method. Part 6


Task 1:
Create a base class Shape with a method for calculating 
the area. Create derived classes: a rectangle, circle, right triangle, trapezoid with their own methods for calculating the area.

Task 2
Override the int (returns the area) and str (returns info 
about a shape) methods from Task 1.

Task 3
Create a base class Shape to draw flat shapes. 
Define the following methods:

■ Show() — print info about a shape;

■ Save() — save a shape to a file;

■ Load() — read a shape from a file.
Define the derived classes: 

■ Square — a square defined by the coordinates of the upper 
left corner and the side length;

■ Rectangle — a rectangle with the specified coordinates of 
the upper left corner and dimensions;

■ Circle — a circle with the specified coordinates of the center and radius;

■ Ellipse — an ellipse with the specified coordinates of 
the top corner of a circumscribed rectangle with its sides 
parallel to the coordinate axes, and the dimensions of this 
rectangle.
Create a list of shapes, save the shapes to a file, load into 
another list, and display information about each shape.
